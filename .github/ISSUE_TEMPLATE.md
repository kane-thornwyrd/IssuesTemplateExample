#### Post the crashlog via pastebin
When you have crashed, there is an crashlog file inside your .minecraft/crashlogs/ folder 
Please upload it either on Pastebin or attach it as attachment, but do **not** paste it as textwall here

#### Check for unsupported modifications
Always test without **optifine** before posting an issue, optifine is not supported!
Also if you play multiplayer check the server and only use default forge server, cauldron and it's branches are not supported.

##### No crashlog present?
Please note down your Minecraft Version, and the Modversion if there is no crashlog and also state if you played in single or multiplayer!

#### Now state your issue, try to make clear what you have done and what happened, you can also add some screeenshots
